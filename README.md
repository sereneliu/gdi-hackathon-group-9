# Visualizing Wage Inequality
## About
Boston, MA has one of the widest gaps between its highest and lowest earning residents in the country. As of part of the Girl Develop It Hackathon, four designers and developers partnered to bring you, "Visualizing Wage Inequality," a data visualization of income inequality in Boston, Chelsea, and Cambridge broken down by race and ethnicity as well as gender.

This is how far we got after 8 hours of coding.
